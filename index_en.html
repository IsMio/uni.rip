     <h1>HSEZ.RIP</h1> 
     <p>"HSEZ.RIP"，stands for the death of No.2 Middle School of Hengshui City (HSEZ for short).</p> 
     <p>This school adopts a management method that regards students as livestocks to be slaughtered, teachers as line workers, the school as a factory.</p>
     <h2>HALL OF SHAME OF THIS SCHOOL</h2> 
     <h3>Effective Speech Censorship</h3> 
     <blockquote> 
      <p>This school punishes students who spread negative news so severely, deletes spreaded negative news so rapidly, investigating phone numbers that report the school to Ministry of Education so urgently that students dare not to speak their voices.<br><b><a href="http://www.npc.gov.cn/npc/c505/201803/e87e5cd7c1ce46ef866f4ec8e2d709ea.shtml#:~:text=%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%89%E5%8D%81%E4%BA%94%E6%9D%A1%E3%80%80%E4%B8%AD%E5%8D%8E%E4%BA%BA%E6%B0%91%E5%85%B1%E5%92%8C%E5%9B%BD%E5%85%AC%E6%B0%91%E6%9C%89%E8%A8%80%E8%AE%BA%E3%80%81%E5%87%BA%E7%89%88%E3%80%81%E9%9B%86%E4%BC%9A%E3%80%81%E7%BB%93%E7%A4%BE%E3%80%81%E6%B8%B8%E8%A1%8C%E3%80%81%E7%A4%BA%E5%A8%81%E7%9A%84%E8%87%AA%E7%94%B1%E3%80%82" rel="nofollow">Constitution of the People's Republic of China, Article 35:</a></b><br><p>Citizens of the People’s Republic of China shall enjoy freedom of speech, the press, assembly, association, procession and demonstration.<br>Seems that the school thinks their students are not citizens of China - or their statements are illegal?</p>

    <h3>Random Corporal Punishment and Verbal Abuse</h3>
    <blockquote>
    <p>If you make the teacher looks unpleasant (for any reason)，then you will get punishments including：</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Being scolded "piece of shit","foolish" in public</p></li>
    <li><p>“Your classes are suspended”</p></li>
    <li><p>Being kicked out a meter away</p></li>
    <li><p>Being slapped with a book</p></li>

    <h3>"Ingenious" Class Grouping Rules</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            Frequent class grouping leads to little trust between students, in order to divide students, prevent them from trusting each other, prevent collusion, make <b>students fight each other</b>, which successfully prevents one so-called "trouble maker" after another.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Having Meal Hurrying, Returning Class Rushing, Only for 5 Minutes, Stomach Aching</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            Its meal schedule is very unreasonable, only 5 minutes for a meal per grade. The total meal time (for all grades) is just 15 minutes. The time it rules to run to the dining hall, wait in line, having meal, and return to the classroom is only 5 minutes. Students can only gobble in order not to starve, or, eat on the way to classroom, and suffer from stomachache in class. How can students face the intense study without a healthy body? To have meals in time, everyone has to keep an eye on the watch, and rush out the classroom when the bell rings. And then, the whole building is filled with landslide-like sound, and students may fall down accidentally, be knocked down by a speeding man, break leg, break toe, or suffer a concussion from falling down...It is not uncommon to see students on crutches, in wheelchairs and in casts on campus. The head of the grade says cynically when he sees it, "Look how many classes have students on wheelchairs, some have two, what for? A competition?"

    <h3>Running intended to please leaders</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            As we all know, the "Running Exercise" is originally created by HSEZ. Being required to line up, all students have to run crowded, the pace and speed must also be consistent, no matter how tall or short, fat or thin. However, in fact, this is very unreasonable, some students must have long legs to run faster than others, there must also be students with short legs, run slower, and so on. If they are forced to run together, then both sides will not feel good, and if someone unfortunately falls, there is a great possibility of causing a trampling incident. In addition, such running exercises do not serve the purpose of physical exercise, but are essentially just an activity to please the leaders under a perverse teaching structure.

    <h3>Disappeared vacation</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            irregulary cram lesson, deliberately shortening the vacation period, and delaying the vacation even though the provincial education department issued a notice requiring it. The regular monthly leave is only one day, even in hours. There are even no vacation at all during the one-month online course, only some 2 hours breaks during the two-and-a-half-month lockdown period due to COVID for students in school, Even in the only 20 days winter vacation, students are forced to obey timetable in school, and even be supervised to do homework in an online meeting software, and cram lessons under the name of tutoring. <br>(Translator note: seems that extra-curricular lessons, which aims to allow students to study ahead for the next semester or review some key points in some subjects under the help of a teacher, no matter the teacher is on or off campus, is uncommon or even non-existent outside China? I fail to find a proper phrase describing this, using "cram lesson" instead.)<br><br>
            In fact, students' vacation life is even worse than prisons.<b><a href="http://www.gov.cn/ziliao/flfg/2005-09/12/content_31186.htm" rel="nofollow">Prison Law of the People's Republic of China, Article 71:</a></b>: "Offenders have the right to rest on legal holidays and rest days."<br><br>Even offenders in prison have the right to rest, why students in HSEZ have no such right, or even worse than a prison?
